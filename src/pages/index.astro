			<p>
				The Cognition and Decision Lab is a joint venture among principal investigators
				<a href='http://www.columbia.edu/~mw2230/'>Michael Woodford</a>,
				<a href='http://www.columbia.edu/~md3405/'>Mark Dean</a> and
				<a href='http://www.afrouzi.com/'>Hassan Afrouzi</a>, faculty members of the Economics Department at Columbia University.
				The lab's aim is to use tools and techniques from Economics, Neuroscience, and Psychology to better understand the cognitive processes underlying economic decision making. Current projects include studying the way in which limited attention is allocated during choice and understanding the role of incomplete preferences in economic decision making. For more information, please contact one of the principal investigators.
